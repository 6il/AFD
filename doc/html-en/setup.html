<h1 align=center>Setup AFD</h1>
<hr size=3 noshade>
<p>
Currently there are two different init systems. The SystemV initd
system and systemd. There is support for both, but you need to
decide this when you compile AFD. If you want to use systemd you
must compile AFD with the configure option --enable-systemd.
</p>
<h1 align=center>Setup with SystemV initd</h1>
<hr size=3 noshade>
<p>
In /etc/sysconfig/afd you can setup under which users AFD is to be
started when system boots. If the user name is donald you need to
set this as follows:
</p>
<pre>
    AFD_USER_0=donald
</pre>
<p>
The AFD_USER_0 is handled via the script /etc/init.d/afd.
More users can be added by incrementing the number:
</p>
<pre>
    AFD_USER_1=daisy
</pre>
<p>
The AFD_HA_USER_0 variable can be used to start AFD users in a high
availability environment via the /etc/init.d/afdha script.
</p>
<p>
If you need to start more then one AFD under one user, it can be done
by using the environment variable MULTI_AFD_DIRS. If the user donald
wants to run three AFD's he needs three different AFD home directories,
it can be done by setting this variable in his .profile file:
</p>
<pre>
   MULTI_AFD_DIRS="/home/donald/tick /home/donald/trick /home/donald/track"
</pre>
<h1 align=center>Setup with systemd</h1>
<hr size=3 noshade>
<p>
Setting up AFD users under systemd can be done via creating an environment
file /etc/afd/&lt;user&gt;_environment.conf for each user. In it you need
to set the working directory of AFD. For the user donald you would have
to create the file /etc/afd/donald_environment.conf with the following
content:
</p>
<pre>
   AFD_WORK_DIR=/home/donald
</pre>
<p>
To start/stop donalds AFD the system administrator needs to run the
following command:
</p>
<pre>
   systemctl start afd@donald.service
   systemctl stop afd@donald.service
</pre>
<p>
If donalds AFD is to be started automatically at boot, the system
administrator needs to run the following command:
</p>
<pre>
   systemctl enable afd@donald.service
</pre>
<p>
And if it is no longer needed it can be removed by the system
administrator with the command:
</p>
<pre>
   systemctl disable afd@donald.service
</pre>
<p>
Under systemd the AFD will not inherit the environment variables of
the user. These need to be set in /etc/afd/&lt;user&gt;_environment.conf.
Alternatively the user can set these variables via
$AFD_WORK_DIR/etc/environment.conf file himself.
</p>
<p>
If possible try and put the environment variables in /etc/afd/&lt;user&gt;_environment.conf.
To only set the values in one file only, put in the users profile the
following:
</p>
<pre>
        if [ -f /etc/afd/${USER}_environment.conf ]
        then
           source /etc/afd/${USER}_environment.conf
           export $(cut -d= -f1 /etc/afd/${USER}_environment.conf)
        fi
</pre>
<p>
If one needs to start more the one AFD under one user it can be done
by copying /usr/lib/systemd/system/afd@.service to etc/systemd/system/afd.target.wants
with a specific name. If the user donald wants to run three AFD's
in his directories ~/tick, ~/trick and ~/track, it can be done as
follows by the system administrator:
</p>
<pre>
   cd /usr/lib/systemd/system
   cp afd@.service afd@donald_tick.service
   cp afd@.service afd@donald_trick.service
   cp afd@.service afd@donald_track.service
</pre>
<p>
These three files must then be modified by the system administrator by
changing the line
</p>
<pre>
   User=%i
</pre>
<p>
as follows:
</p>
<pre>
   User=donald
</pre>
<p>
Next the three environment files donald_tick_environment.conf,
donald_trick_environment.conf and donald_track_environment.conf
need to be created in /etc/afd with the following contend:
</p>
<pre>
   cat /etc/afd/donald_tick_environment.conf
   AFD_WORK_DIR=/home/donald/tick

   cat /etc/afd/donald_trick_environment.conf
   AFD_WORK_DIR=/home/donald/trick

   cat /etc/afd/donald_track_environment.conf
   AFD_WORK_DIR=/home/donald/track
</pre>
<p>
Then issue the command 'systemctl daemon-reload', so systemd sees those
modifications.
