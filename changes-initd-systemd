Since systemd is completely different to System V initd, there
are some changes in running AFD as a background daemon.

   - When AFD is started via systemd not all process will now
     terminate when you stop AFD (afd -s). There will always
     be a process left called init_afd which is under control
     of systemd. If you really need to stop all process you
     can do so via 'afd -s --all'. But if you do this and you
     start AFD again and the system is then shutdown, AFD will
     not be terminated properly. Or if the AFD package of the
     system is updated your private AFD instance will not be
     notified and depending on the changes, not work correctly.
     So it is best to leave the init_afd instance of systemd active.

   - Environment variables from users are no longer inherited.
     Variables that you need via one of the AFD exec option
     you can set either by setting them in the environment
     file of the AFD instance /etc/afd/*_environment.conf.
     You may also set environment varibles in the file
     $AFD_WORK_DIR/etc/environment.conf. If this exists AMG
     and FD will include them into their environment.
     It is also possible to pass these variables via the
     exec option.

     So that you do only edit the environment variables at one
     place one can source the variables from the AFD instance
     environment file in your .bash_profile as follows:

        if [ -f /etc/afd/${USER}_environment.conf ]
        then
           source /etc/afd/${USER}_environment.conf
           export $(cut -d= -f1 /etc/afd/${USER}_environment.conf)
        fi

     The AFD instance running under systemd will have the
     following (incomplete) list of variables set:

        SHELL, PWD, LOGNAME, HOME, LANG, USER, AFD_WORK_DIR, PATH,
        OLDPWD

     This is what was is set in Fedora 32 and might differ
     from distribution or release number. You can simply check
     this by looking at the content of the file
     $AFD_WORK_DIR/etc/fifodir/environment_variables_set.txt

   - Starting multiple AFD's with the help of the environment
     variable MULTI_AFD_DIRS will not work. If you need to start
     more then one AFD under the same user you can do it as
     follows:

     1) Copy the afd@.service file with an instance name foo
        to /etc/systemd/system/afd.target.wants as follows:

          cd /usr/lib/systemd/system
          cp afd@.service afd@foo.service

        Edit the file afd@foo.service and change the line
        'User=%i' by resolving %i to the real username under
        which the AFD instance should run. Then do a
        'systemctl daemon-reload'.

     2) Next create the environment file /etc/afd/foo_environment.conf
        and set the variable AFD_WORK_DIR variable to point to the
        directory where this AFD instance should run.

     3) Via systemd you can now enable this instance:

          systemctl enable afd@foo

     If the content of afd@.service changes, you always need to repeat
     the above procedure.

   - There is no support to automatically convert the /etc/sysconfig/afd
     and /etc/sysconfig/afdmon SystemV initd to the systemd
     /etc/afd/${USER}_environment.conf files. So you need to do
     this by hand.
